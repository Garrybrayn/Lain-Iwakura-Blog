    <h2>Cyberia</h2>
    <p>The girls say they're sure they saw me at Cyberia last night. They didn't believe me when I told them it wasn't me. Arisu told them to knock it off, that she believed me. Funy thing is, I think I may have been there, it just wasn't me. She wasn't like me at all.</p>

    <h2>Chisa Yamoda</h2>
    <p>She emailed me too. Sent after she died, just like everyone else's. She says she's not really dead. She abandoned the physical world and is now alive in the Wired.</p>
